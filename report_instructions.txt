I have completed the full data analysis and created a comprehensive 10-page report.
However, PDF generation tools (LaTeX, Pandoc) are not available on your system.

HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:

1. Install Pandoc: https://pandoc.org/installing.html

2. Run this command in the terminal:
   cd /Users/sanaz/TU_Dort_DS
   pandoc Cycling_Performance_Analysis_Report.md -o Final_Report.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex

OPTION 2 - Use Online Converter:
---------------------------------
1. Go to: https://www.markdowntopdf.com/
   OR: https://md2pdf.netlify.app/

2. Upload the file: Cycling_Performance_Analysis_Report.md

3. Download the PDF

OPTION 3 - Use Microsoft Word/Google Docs:
-------------------------------------------
1. Open Cycling_Performance_Analysis_Report.md in a text editor
2. Copy all content
3. Paste into Microsoft Word or Google Docs
4. Insert the 4 PNG plot images at their respective figure locations
5. Format as needed (adjust spacing, fonts)
6. Export as PDF: File → Save As → PDF

OPTION 4 - Install LaTeX and Compile:
--------------------------------------
1. Install MacTeX: https://www.tug.org/mactex/
